# DevSecOps

### Prerequisites:
 - Software Engineering Fundamentals
 - Basic knowledge of Linux/Unix systems
 - Programming and Scripting experience (Python, Shell, etc.)

### Course Description:

This course introduces the principles, practices, and tools involved in DevSecOps. It covers the integration of development and operations teams, automation of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), and continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Students will gain experience with tools and techniques used in modern DevOps practices, including source control, configuration management, containerization, monitoring, and cloud infrastructure.

### Course Objectives:
By the end of this course, students should be able to:
1. Understand the core principles and culture of DevSecOps.
2. Set up and use Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.
3. Automate deployment processes using containerization tools like Docker.
4. Use infrastructure as code (IaC) tools to manage and automate infrastructure.
